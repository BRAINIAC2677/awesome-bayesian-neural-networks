### Github Repositories
- [BayesianTorch](https://github.com/IntelLabs/bayesian-torch) - Bayesian-Torch is a library of neural network layers and utilities extending the core of PyTorch to enable Bayesian inference in deep learning models to quantify principled uncertainty estimates in model predictions.

- [bayesian-neural-network-pytorch](https://github.com/Harry24k/bayesian-neural-network-pytorch) - This is a lightweight repository of bayesian neural network for PyTorch.

- [Bayesian Machine Learning](https://github.com/krasserm/bayesian-machine-learning) - This repository is a collection of notebooks about Bayesian Machine Learning.

- [PyTorch-BayesianCNN](https://github.com/kumar-shridhar/PyTorch-BayesianCNN) - We introduce Bayesian convolutional neural networks with variational inference, a variant of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in which the intractable posterior probability distributions over weights are inferred by Bayes by Backprop.

- [Bayesian Statistics](https://github.com/storopoli/Bayesian-Statistics) - This repository holds slides and code for a full Bayesian statistics graduate course.

- [BLiTZ](https://github.com/piEsposito/blitz-bayesian-deep-learning) - BLiTZ is a simple and extensible library to create Bayesian Neural Network Layers (based on whats proposed in Weight Uncertainty in Neural Networks paper) on PyTorch. 

- [BayesianDeepLearning-Survey](https://github.com/js05212/BayesianDeepLearning-Survey) - This is an updating survey for Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL), an constantly updated and extended version for the manuscript, 'A Survey on Bayesian Deep Learning', published in ACM Computing Surveys 2020.


### Tools
- [TorchUncertainty](https://torch-uncertainty.github.io/) - TorchUncertainty is a package designed to help you leverage uncertainty quantification techniques and make your deep neural networks more reliable.  

- [Pyro](https://pyro.ai/) - Pyro is a flexible, scalable deep probabilistic programming library built on PyTorch.

- [PyMC](https://www.pymc.io/welcome.html) - PyMC (formerly PyMC3) is a Python package for Bayesian statistical modeling focusing on advanced Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational inference (VI) algorithms. Its flexibility and extensibility make it applicable to a large suite of problems.

- [Arviz](https://github.com/arviz-devs/arviz) - ArviZ (pronounced "AR-vees") is a Python package for exploratory analysis of Bayesian models. It includes functions for posterior analysis, data storage, model checking, comparison and diagnostics.
